view existing contours, create, edit, modify, copy contours of regions of the body, such as but not limited to, skin outline, targets and organs-at-risk. it also provides functionalities to create simple geometric treatment plans. contours, images and treatment plans can subsequently be exported to a treatment planning system. the software combines the following digital image processing and visualization tools: \uf0a7 multi-modality viewing and contouring of anatomical, functional, and multi-parametric images such as but not limited to ct, pet, pet/ct, mri, linac cone beam ct (cbct) images \uf0a7 multiplanar reconstruction (mpr) thin/thick, minimum intensity projection (mip), volume rendering technique (vrt) \uf0a7 freehand and semi-automatic contouring of regions-of-interest on
